Here we store the data for the nonlinear diffusion PDE described in Appendix. The other data files are larger than the Github's limit, so we openly distribute them via [OneDrive](https://chula-my.sharepoint.com/:f:/g/personal/pongpisit_t_alumni_chula_ac_th/EtASN5hO5X9AoQPDx9DAaMwBY-rjlieAaA2eVQl4sI_TBQ?e=5JzRmt) (password: nPIML_appendix) instead.

Navier-Stokes PDE: `Cylinder_{U, V, W}.npy` are the simulated solutions. | `nv_originalv2_noiselv2.h5` contains the noisy polynomial candidate library and the corresponding time derivative vector.

2D Reaction-Diffusion PDE: `reaction_diffusion_2d_big.mat`  
3D Reaction-Diffusion PDE: `reaction_diffusion_3d_{128, 64, 32}.mat`. 128, 64 and 32 denote the different numbers of points in the three spatial directions.
